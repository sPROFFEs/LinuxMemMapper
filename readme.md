## Description

Linux Memory Mapper (LMM) is a powerful diagnostic tool that allows users to:
- List memory regions of any running process
- View detailed memory mapping information
- Dump specific memory regions to binary files
- Analyze process memory layout with ease

Perfect for reverse engineering, debugging, and low-level system analysis tasks.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sPROFFEs/LinuxMemMapper.git
Navigate to the directory:

bash
Copy
cd LinuxMemMapper
Make the script executable:

bash
Copy
chmod +x LMM.sh
Usage
Basic syntax:

bash
Copy
./LMM.sh
Example workflow:

bash
Copy
$ ./LMM.sh
Enter the PID of the target process: 1234

Process Name: example_process
Memory Regions:
1. Start: 00400000 End: 00401000 Perm: r-xp | File: /usr/bin/example_process
2. Start: 00600000 End: 00602000 Perm: rw-p | File: [heap]
...

Enter the number of the region to dump (or 'q' to quit): 2
Enter output filename: heap_dump.bin
Dumping region 2 to heap_dump.bin...
32768 bytes dumped successfully!
